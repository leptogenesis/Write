## Building ##

Checkout: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/styluslabs/Write`

To build executable `syncscribble/Release/Write`:
* Linux: `cd syncscribble && make USE_SYSTEM_SDL=1`; On Debian/Ubuntu, `apt install build-essential libsdl2-dev`.  Copy fonts from scribbleres/fonts to syncscribble/Release before running Write.
* Android (on Linux): `cd syncscribble/android && ./gww installRelease`; to install Android SDK and NDK, run `gww --install-sdk`
* iOS:
 * build SDL: `cd SDL && git checkout write-mac && make -f ../scribbleres/SDL-Makefile.ios`
 * see [nanovgXC readme](https://github.com/styluslabs/nanovgXC?tab=readme-ov-file#example-app) for setup and then run `cd syncscribble && make` or use the [Xcode project](xcode/Write).
* macOS: `cd syncscribble && make MACOS=1`
* Windows:
 * install Visual Studio (free Community Edition is fine) and [GNU make for Windows](http://www.equation.com/servlet/equation.cmd?fa=make), ensuring it is available in the path
 * in `syncscribble/Makefile`, set `DEPENDBASE` to the parent folder containing all dependencies that `make` should track
 * build SDL: `cd SDL && git checkout write-win && make -f ../scribbleres/SDL-Makefile.msvc`
 * open a Visual Studio command prompt (from the Start Menu) and run `cd syncscribble && make`

##About This Fork
I added a LASERPOINTER Option, Below Ephemeral Pen. If this is selected, when the mouse is hovering, it will show a red circling a black dot as a cursor.
I use Write during my lecture. The laserpointer helps me to point out the actual region on Write that I am talking about. I tested it in OSX. I would be happt to
get such a laser pointer also on the ipad.
